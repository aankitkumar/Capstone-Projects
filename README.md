# Capstone-Projects

This repository contains my capstone project, done for understanding & using data analysis, visualization and machine learning techniques. The asssignments are completed using Python, Numpy, DateTime, Pandas, Matplotlib and scikit-learn with Jupyter notebooks.

The overview of projects are as below, while further details are at beginning of each project .md file: 

## Project 1
*Understanding and predicting property maintenance fines*

- To solve the issue of blight violations and to increase blight compliance for proper fine collection by the city administratin for deteriorated condition of property.
- Using predicting modelling (with regression), to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time

## Project 2
*Weather data pattern analysis & visualization*

- To analyze real world climate data for each day from 2005- 2014 and finding relative high or low temperature in 2015
- Using composite plots to show the record temperature for each day

## Project 3
*Analysis of renewable energy consumption in relation to energy technology research publications*

- To Study of renewable energy consumption in relation to energy technology publications and anwering the related questions. This requires data frame creation, data set mearging & processing from different sources and data analysis.
- Finding correlation between energy supply and  citable research publications per catpita

## Project 4

*Hypothesis Testing*
- Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions.
- Prove hypothesis using t-tests & data analysis.
